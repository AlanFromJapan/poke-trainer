App to help kids to learn to read with Pokemons (based on **pokeapi** https://pokeapi.co/)

Could be multilingual, most likely won't for it's already a miracle if I have time to write it to a useable state somehow. Will try to not make it completely language-locked if I can.

## What
Basically having young kids at home, poke-addicted, so it's a good way to use that to teach them a bit of reading, pronounciation, etc while having fun learning pokemon names while it lasts.
